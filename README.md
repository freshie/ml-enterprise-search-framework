# ml-enterprise-search-framework
A framework for building an enterprise search application on MarkLogic

This is a work in process right.

I've work on many marklogic search applcation all for large enterpirses. 

This is meant to be a framework to capture the work done by each one with out specific logic for those enterpirse.

It will do what search:search does but and on to it with more advance search feartures.

It will be configuration based.
